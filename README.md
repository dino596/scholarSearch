# Overview

Welcome to ScholarSearch, a tool developed to help prospective graduates find the right colleges for them to simplify the college application process. 

# Home Page

Here you will be welcomed to your ScholarSearch account. A naviagtion bar rests at the top of the page where you can click on different features of your account. Just below that the home page shows the deadlines of the colleges you added to your personal list. Below that is three articles suggested for you to learn more about the college application process and to teach you how to craft the best application. 

You can return to the Home Page by clicking "ScholarSearch" in the upper left-hand corner if you navigate out of it.

# Search Page

Under the "Search" tab you can search for any college in the United States. It must be the full name of the college or university in order to be processed by our database (i.e. University of California, San Diego--NOT UCSD). When a college appears under the search bar, you can click the button to add it to your main list. 

# List Page

Under the "List" tab you will find all the colleges you added to your list from the "Search" page. From here you can sort your colleges into three different lists using the buttons at the bottom of the page. You can also press "delete" to delete any college from your list. 

You must first click on a school in the list, see it highligth in yellow, then you can press either "match," "reach," or "safety" to sort it into either of those three lists. You will see the college visibly sort into the lists when you do this. 

This will help you see if the types of schools you're applying to are balanced. 

# Match Page

Under the "Match" tab you can do a quiz that will generate a recommended list of colleges based on your input. The quiz will ask you things like what climate you'd prefer in a school, what size, teacher to student ratio, public versus private, etc. 

This is aimed to help you find schools which cater towards your preferences in a campus, making your search process easier.  

# Profile/Login Page
